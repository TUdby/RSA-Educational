# RSA-Educational
The readme walks through RSA and the building of the example code provided.


# Basic RSA
RSA can be enhanced by something called the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We will go over 
that, but first we will go over basic RSA without it.

## The Algorithm
Assume we have a private key "Priv" and a public key "Pub" as shown below (we will 
show where they come from later). The algorithm for encrypting and decrypting is as
follows, where k is the original number and h is the encrypted number.
